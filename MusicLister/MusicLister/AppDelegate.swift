         Part 1
         - Create a UITableView that displays a list of your top 15 favorite songs.
         - Each cell should display (at least) the artist, album, track name, genre, and track length.
         - The song data can be hard-coded.
         - Use a mixture of different artists, albums, and genres.
         - The interface should be able to rotate.
         
         Part 2
         - Allow the user to swipe a cell to mark an item as a favorite or to unfavorite an item.
         - There should be some sort of indication that a cell is favorited.
         - As of now there should have been a single view (a UITableView). Add a UITabBar with 2 tabs. The first tab should contain the original table view. The second tab should contain a new table view with the list of favorites. The interface and features should be the same as the first tab.
         - If a user unfavorites an item from the favorites tab it should be removed from the table view.
         - Favorites do not need to be persisted if the user quits the app.
         
         Part 3
         - Add a search bar that allows the user to filter the results.
         - The filter should apply to the artist, album, track name, and genre.
         
         Part 4
         - Add a UISegmentedControl with the following segments: All, Artist, Album, Genre.
         - By default 'All' should be selected.
         - Selecting 'Artist', 'Album', or 'Genre' should display a single cell for each unique grouping. For example, selecting 'Genre' could have cells labeled 'Reggae', 'Hip-Hop', and 'Jazz'.
         - Selecting a cell should push a new UIViewController with a UITableView containing all items for that category using a UINavigationController.
         
         Part 5
         - When a user force-quits the app and later re-launches it, the favorited items should still be persisted.
